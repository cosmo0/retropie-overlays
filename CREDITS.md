# Credits

Most of the heavy work has been done by others. I have mostly moved files around to make it work for Retropie, and edited a bunch of config files.

I honestly do not remember where I picked each overlay since I spent a LOT of time browsing various forums. Here are a few places I picked images from. I have not used all of them.

The order of the packs is the order I found them.

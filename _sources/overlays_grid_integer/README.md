# Integer scaled overlays with grids

## Content

Each system has an appropriate overlay configured, and the emulators are integer-scaled.

Systems have a "scanlines" or "LCD grid" baked into the overlay, so it's not possible to remove it without editing the images.

If you want to use a shader instead of the grills, or you think it looks ugly, just do not use this pack.
